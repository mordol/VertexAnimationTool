# VertexAnimationTool
This project was created to implement and test the following features:
* Bake multiple animations to texture
* GPU instanced drawing and speed control
* ~~Testing reduced texture sampling frequency with a vertex-oriented layout~~ <- This test was terminated due to a significant performance decrease from reduced cache hit rates, outweighing the performance increase from reduced instructions.

The following assets were used for the test scene:
